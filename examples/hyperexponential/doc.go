// Package hyperexponential contains implementations of algorithms with
// O(n^n) hyperexponential time complexity.
//
// Hyperexponential algorithms have complexity that grows as n raised to the
// power of n, which is even worse than factorial O(n!) for large n.
// These algorithms are extremely limited in practical application due to
// their explosive growth rate.
//
// Examples:
//   - n=1: 1^1 = 1 operation
//   - n=2: 2^2 = 4 operations
//   - n=3: 3^3 = 27 operations
//   - n=4: 4^4 = 256 operations
//   - n=5: 5^5 = 3,125 operations
//   - n=6: 6^6 = 46,656 operations
//
// Due to the extreme growth rate, benchmarks are typically limited to n â‰¤ 5.
