// Package constant contains implementations of algorithms with
// O(1) constant time complexity.
//
// Constant time algorithms perform the same number of operations regardless
// of input size. This is the most efficient complexity class, better than
// logarithmic O(log n) complexity. Operations execute in fixed time
// regardless of data size.
//
// Examples:
//   - n=1: 1 operation
//   - n=1000: 1 operation
//   - n=1000000: 1 operation
//   - n=1000000000: 1 operation
//
// Common use cases include array/slice indexing, hash table lookups,
// stack push/pop, queue enqueue/dequeue, and basic arithmetic operations.
//
// Benchmarks can safely test very large input sizes (n â‰¤ 10^9) since
// performance remains constant regardless of input magnitude.
